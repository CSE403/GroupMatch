						<h1>What is GroupMatch?</h1>
					</header>
					<p>
					Too often it is necessary to coordinate large groups of people based on their availabilities and interests. The matching process can be challenging and time-consuming, leading to unnecessary frustration. GroupMatch is created to make this group organization process simple and worry-free. GroupMatch is a polling website that allows users to generate polls of basic preference questions with a limited number of answers (such as What time works for you? or Which group would you like to be in?). 
					</p>
					<p>
					Poll creators can then publish the URL to the poll, allowing other users to specify their preferences, and a ranking of each preference. Once preferences are specified, GroupMatch can provide the poll creator with the optimal way of grouping the users into the desired categories. It can save the poll creator the headache of tracking down each individual person, tallying their input, and then trying to manually assign people to groups. The user-friendly online system of GroupMatch allows each person to provide feedback at their convenience. The program allows the poll creator to easily survey the preferences of everyone that responded, as well as see the computed optimal group assignments. This friendly user interface ultimately creates an easy, stress-free process for all parties.
